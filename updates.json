            "copy": "Science is often seen as a way to measure and define the worldâ€”through observation, calculation, and verification. But what happens when these tools reveal more than they can contain? Matter Mattering Matters explores this tension, bringing together artists, philosophers, and theorists who challenge the ways we think about knowledge, truth, and the material world.\n\nMoving across disciplines and registers, the contributions contend with the poetics of quantum mechanics, the politics of planetary observation, and the speculative possibilities of human and more than human cognition. How do we make sense of the universe? How do scientific and creative practices shape the way we see, measure, and interact with the world? \n\nEdited by Kabelo Malatsie & Lantian Xie \n\nWith contributions by Karen Barad, Simnikiwe Buhlungu, Nolan Oswald Dennis, Rohini Devasher & Sabih Ahmed, Merve Ertufan, Ivana Franke, Jackie Karuti, George Mahashe, sidony o'neal, Raqs Media Collective, Oscar Santillan, Bogosi Sekhukhuni, & Aarti Sunder",
