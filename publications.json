    "content": "Mass Traffic is a kino-political theory of the 21st century. From political fictions to statistical abstractions, the book renders motion as a theoria complex. Concepts take the shape of brawl clouds and images surge as high-heat crispy formulations, reading the contemporary world through exponentiality and exuberance. Congestions of bureaucratic procedures meet the traffic of indeterminate actions—singing, swerving and dispersing across chapters on: organs; culture; the archive Infra-habibi-technics; the exhibitionary supply chain. Lantian Xie is an artist mobilising images, objects, things, things that happen, formulations, swerves, jumps, books, working groups, jazz bands, motorcycles, and parties. Sabih Ahmed is a curator moving between exhibitions, infra-/para-/axial-institutional appearances, archives, pedagogy, and theorisation.

The meeting was held by the Visual Arts Network of South Africa (VANSA) from 2–5 October 2018.\nThe meeting itself emerged out of a report by VANSA, commissioned by the Ford Foundation Southern Africa in 2016/17. The original report was an in-depth discussion on new forms of arts organising in Southern Africa, the state of arts infrastructure in the region, and a longer discussion of the impact of the history of the region. This publication includes some excerpts from that report and brings these together with thoughts and learnings that emerged out of the organising workshop.",
